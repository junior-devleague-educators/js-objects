# JavaScript Objects

Objects in JavaScript can be compared to objects in real life. Objects have a collection of properties associated with it (known as key-value pairs). Please do the following exercises in CodePen, REPL, or JSBin.

## Literal Objects

1.  Declare a variable named `dog` and create the following properties (key-value pairs) to the object:

* Add a key named `name` and set it to a string value of your choice.
* Add a key named `age` and set it to a number value of your choice.
* add a key named `vegetarian` and set it to a boolean value of your choice.
* Add a key named `color` and set it to an array with two string elements in it.
* Add a key named `speak` and set it to a `"woof!"`
* Console log the following phrase by accessing the appropriate object properties: `"My dog -name- is -age- years old and likes to -speak-"`

2.  Declare a variable named `recipe` and create the following properties (key-value pairs) to the object:

* Add a key named `name` and set it to a string value of the title of a recipe.
* Add a key named `ingredients` and set it to an array of strings containing 4 ingredients needed to create your recipe.
* Add a key named `quantity` and set it to a number value of how many servings the recipe can make.
* Add a key named `isBaked` and set it to a boolean value.
* Console log the whole object.

## Empty Objects

1.  Declare a variable named `kicks` and assign it to an EMPTY object. Next you will add the following properties to this object with DOT NOTATION:

* Add a property named `brand` and set it to your favorite sneaker brand.
* Add a property named `color` and set it the value to your favorite color.
* Add a property named `size` and set it to your shoe size.
* Add a property named `buy` and set it to a method that will return a string "Yes!"
* Console log the entire object.

2.  Declare a variable named `treasureChest` and set its value to be an EMPTY object. Next, you will add three properties to this object with BRACKET NOTATION:

* Add a property named `texture` and set it any texture (soft, rough, fluffy, etc).
* Add a property named `size` and set it to a number value between `0` and `20`.
* Add a property named `contents` and set it to an array of string values that you would hope to find in a treasure chest.
* Console log the following phrase by accessing the appropriate object properties: `"I found a -texture- treasure chest, and to my surprise found -content at index 0-, and "-content at index 1-`

3.  Declare a variable named `car` and set its value to be an EMPTY object. Next, you will add 5 properties to this object with DOT NOTATION:

* Add a key named `model` and set its value to the name of a car manufacturer.
* Add a key named `year` and set it to be a number value above 2000 but below 2016.
* Add a key named `automaticTransmission` and give it a Boolean value of your choice.
* Add a key named `driver` and set it to be `null`.
* Add a key named `passengers` and set it to be an empty array.
* Console log the entire object.

## Accessing Objects

Use bracket notation to do the following:

1.  From the `dog` object console log the value of the `color`
2.  From the `recipe` object console log the value of `quantity`
3.  From the `kicks` object console log the value of `brand`
4.  From the the `treasureChest` object console log the value of `contents`
5.  From the `car` object console log the value of `passengers`

Use dot notation to do the following:

1.  From the `dog` object console log the value of `vegetarian`
2.  From the `recipe` object console log the value of `ingredients`
3.  From the `kicks` object console log the value of `size`
4.  From the `treasureChest` object console log the value of `texture`
5.  From the `car` object console log the value of `model`
